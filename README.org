* Mahogany
  Mahogany is a tiling window manager for Wayland modeled after
  stumpwm. While it is not a drop-in replacement for stumpwm, stumpwm
  users should be very comfortable with Mahogany. It features:
  + Easy extensibility: through the use of different modes, users can
    modify keybindings present in Mahogany, and even have different
    keybindings for each program.
  + Programs to interact with other running services such as
    pulseaudio and alsamixer, as well as facilities to controll screen
    brightness.
